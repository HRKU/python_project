README: Resume Web App

This README provides step-by-step instructions to set up and operate the Resume Web App project. If you haven't used this project for a while and need a refresher on how it works, follow the steps below.

1. Clone the project:
   - Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine.

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   - It is considered good practice to create a virtual environment for your project. This step helps isolate the project's dependencies. In your project directory, run the following command:

     ```shell
     python -m venv env
     ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Activate the virtual environment to ensure that your project uses the correct Python interpreter and installed packages. The command may vary based on your operating system.

   - For Windows (Command Prompt):

     ```shell
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```

4. Install project dependencies:
   - Django projects typically rely on various dependencies listed in a `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile` file. Install these dependencies using the package manager of your choice. If you are using pip and a `requirements.txt` file, run the following command:

     ```shell
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

5. Prepare the database:
   - Django projects often require a database. If your project uses a database, you need to run database migrations and create a superuser account. Execute the following commands:

     ```shell
     python manage.py migrate
     python manage.py createsuperuser  # This step is optional, mainly for admin purposes
     ```

6. Run the development server:
   - Start the Django development server to run the project locally. Use the following command:

     ```shell
     python manage.py runserver
     ```

   - The server should start running, and you should see output similar to the following:

     ```
     Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
     Quit the server with CTRL-BREAK.
     ```

     Access the provided URL in your web browser to view and interact with the Resume Web App.

These instructions should help you get the project up and running smoothly. If you encounter any issues or have further questions, feel free to ask for assistance.
